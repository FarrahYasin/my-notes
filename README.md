### What I learned from today's lecture:

I learned alot of useful things today such as information about the concept of (CLI & GUI), we learned important commands to use when when we using the CLI,
  **This is some of the commands:**
-**mkdir** :this to create new directory.
-**touch** :  this to create new file.
-**ls** : this to list all folders in the directory.
-**cd** : change directory.
-**cd ..** : this to back one step.
-**cd ../..** : this to back two steps.
-**code .** : this to open vs code.
-**clear** : this to clear all comand on the screen.
-**cd ~** : this to move to user directory.
-**explorer.exe**: to open it from terminal.

Then we learned an important thing we will use it alot in our course (**github**), we learned about **repository**(repo) and how we can create the repo, we can create a new repo by click on new repo from my profile in github then we must fill som information in this repo like name and owner and choose if we want the repo public or private.
then after we learned creating a repo, we learned how clone it (this step to make exact copy(repo) to my local machine), this step we can do it by write this command on terminal
`git clone______`in this space we must add link by choosing  ssh from code button in repo and copy the link
then we complete our command like this:
`git clone link`
now my repo beacome on my laptop.

Now we can go to vs code from terminal by write `code .` then we can do any edit on this file

Now to push our file to github after editing we must to do **ACP**:
```
-git add .
-git commit -m "commit massage"
-git push origin main
```
Now our changes are become in github(file after editing now on github).


Also we learned how to create a **SSH key**, by this command
`cd && ssh-keygen && cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
then we copy the text and past it in the github(after choosing ***new SSH key*** from setting)
then now we created it.

Also we learned some about markdown language:
-heading tag
-unordered list
-ordered list
-how to add a image **![description](url of the image)**
-how to write **bold text** 
-how to write **italic text**
